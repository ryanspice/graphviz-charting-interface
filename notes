        - render multiple charts
        - tab management

    refactoring
        print preview force white theme

    re-render properly
    fab + details
    + button
    smooth zooming

    fix highlights

later:

  use stats graph to export current app

  look into native export functionality

    const render = shell.exec(`dot -Tsvg -o ${svgFile} ${dotFile}`);
    if (render.code !== 0) {
      error('Render failed');
      process.exit(1);
    }

    const svg = shell.cat(svgFile);
    const svgDatauri = new DataURI();
    svgDatauri.format('.svg', svg);
    const htmlFile = path.join(outputDirectory, '/interactive.html');
    ShellString(interactiveHtml(svgDatauri.content)).to(htmlFile);
